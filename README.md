# capstone

Epitope prediction capstone. Uses 3D protein structure prediction for epitope prediction by considering structural constraints on antigen processing. Currently exploring methods for b-factor prediction using AF2 outputs. Working towards a final goal of a straightforward solution to generating epitope predictions, given an antigen sequence.

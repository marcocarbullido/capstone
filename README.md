# capstone
Capstone for using protein 3D structure prediction for epitope prediction by considering structural constraints on antigen processing.

Currently exploring methods for b-factor prediction using AF2 outputs. Working towards a straightforward solution to generating epitope predictions given an antigen sequence.
